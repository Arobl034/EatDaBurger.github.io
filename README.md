Eat Da Burger!

A Burger Eatin' Application With Node.js/Express/MySQL/Handlebars

Description

This application demonstrates a simple full stack application with a front end implemented with HTML/CSS and the backend implemented with Node.js and Express. HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars.

The user may enter any burger name to add it to the menu. The initial burger entry is submitted then added on the Burgers to Eat menu and placed on the left side of the screen. The user may then eat any burger by clicking on it, which moves it into the Devoured Burgers and updates its status accordingly.
